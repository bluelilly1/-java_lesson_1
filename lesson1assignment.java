    //Example: printing out the value of a math expression, 5*2
    int product = 5 * 2;//creates an integer variable called product and assigns it to the expression
    System.out.print(product); //prints out the value of the expression
    
    //Make a string variable and assign it to your name
    String name = "Your name here";
    //print out your name here

    //make a variable and assign it to an math expression, like 2+3
    int expression = 2 + 3; //sub with any expression you like

    //print it out here
    
    //make a variable and assign it to a boolean, true or false
    boolean notTrue = false; //substitute with your own value and change the variable name

    //print it out here

  }

//Debugging Tips
  //if it doesn't work, see if there is a red squiggly under anythinh, and if there is, hover over it and the program will tell you what's wrong
  
  //make sure every statement has a semi colon

  //make sure everything is spelled and capitalized correctly, Java is very picky about this

  //If you still can't figure it out, DON'T worry, you can get help and ask your peers in the Q & A session or email me at any time
